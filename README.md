## My name is Roman Larionov ðŸ‘‹

And I am python specialist from Russia.

Currently I am working on a voice assistant open-source project, it is one of the relatively large ones.

I am developing several small projects for the Linux CLI, for everyday tasks in Termux shell:
* Training diary
* Meditation timer
* News parser

Also I am developing two more projects to <b>analyze the securities market based on neural networks, as well as trading in the financial market</b>, which are located in my private repositories because In these projects, I would like to pay additional <u>attention to data security</u> and not publish the WIP code.

### :airplane: Background
I have a higher technical education and more than 8 years of experience as engineers in the aircraft manufacturing industry. In this job I developed structures and systems for many large aircraft. I like to optimize the interaction of components and find the best solutions when designing. The same as with programming.

### :lotus_position: Hobby
I practice Falun Gong (Qigong school) and meditation, which allows me to maintain work-life balance and maintain productivity. Some of my projects are also dedicated to this.
